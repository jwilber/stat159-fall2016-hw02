This folder contains the code used for the assignment.
It contains the following two files:

*`eda-script.R`: Reads in the A`dvertising.csv` data set, and computes summary statistics and histograms of TV and Sales. The summary statistics are saved in the file `eda-output.txt`. The charts are saved in both PNG and PDF formats.
*`regression-script.R`: Reads in the `Advertising.csv` data set, and computes a "regression" object---via `lm()`---as well as the summary of such regression object---via `summary()`. This script also produces the scatterplot with the regression line. The R objects from the regression analysis are saved in the file `regression.RData`. The scatterplot is saved in both PNG and PDF formats.
